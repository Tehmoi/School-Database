# School-Database
A final project for my C# level 2 course. Using SQLite for the database, it takes on new names, new grades, and shows a graph of the scores on the generated exam webpage. 
New teacher names, new students, and scores can be manually created. 
 Teachers, students, and exams are not intrinsically linked.
